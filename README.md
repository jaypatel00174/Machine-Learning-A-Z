# Machine-Learning-A-Z
Here you will learn Machine Learning from the start. We have code all the concepts in both python and R.

I have organized eche concepts in proper folder structure so that you can navigate easily. We have templates also for the different concept that you can use easily.

### Implemented Technology
1. ptyhon
2. R

- Jupyter notebook (you may get with anaconda) - for pthone notebooks .ipynb
- spyder (you may get with anaconda) - pythone IDE
- R 
- R studio - R IDE

This is the the refect of Udemy machine learning course(https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/). For more detail you can opt that course though I have tried to explain all the conept in notebooks that is in HTML too.

#### Hope you get most of the knowledge from here!

This still incomplet I will upload every new concept on regular basis. Happy coding! Do Machine Learning :)
